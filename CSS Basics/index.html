            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Inline CSS</li>
            <p>Inline CSS allows you to apply unique styles directly to individual HTML elements by using the style attribute within the opening tag. It is written as style="property: value;" and is particularly useful for quick styling without affecting other parts of the document. However, it can make your code less organized and harder to maintain for larger projects. Inline CSS overrides styles from external or internal style sheets. While it's convenient for testing or one-off styles, it's best avoided for complex layouts.

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Internal CSS</li>
            <p>
                Internal CSS is used to define styles within a &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document. It applies styles to the entire page or specific elements within the document and is useful for single-page applications. Unlike inline CSS, it keeps your code more organized by separating styles from individual elements. Internal CSS has higher specificity than external styles but lower specificity compared to inline styles. However, it's not ideal for multi-page projects since styles are confined to that specific HTML file.

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">External CSS</li>
            <p>
                External CSS involves linking an HTML document to an external stylesheet using the &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. This method allows you to apply styles across multiple web pages, promoting consistency and easier maintenance. External styles are stored in a separate .css
